        <h2>2<sup>8</sup> Words</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Gabe. I’m a Data Scientist. I tinker with data, sound, and
            pixels.</p>
        <p>Data shows us facets of the world that are hard to see, hard to
            understand, and sometimes hard to believe. At its best, data can
            enlighten us, improve us, challenge us, but at its worst it can lie
            to us, deceive us, or sometimes even destroy us.</p>
        <p>Data is gray. Whether it takes shape as 41.20hz rumbling sine waves
            shaking a dance floor, a warbling affine distortion on an image of a
            beautiful snowtop mountain, or a set of people occluded by IDs
            reporting on their current state of health – the world speaks to me
            in data. I listen and analyze, manipulate and tinker, watching the
            breath of data and how it changes and responds.</p>
        <p>Other than noting on the remarkable beauty of life, I’ve been
            building digital products for two years as a Product Manager. After
            experiencing the ins and outs of building a product, I found a deep
            passion designing performance metrics for complex system
            architectures and guiding the development of UX features based on
            user interaction data. This is what lead me deeper into Data
            Science.<p>
                <p>Here are some of things I’ve built:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ETL architectures, Data Warehouses, and Analytic
                        infrastructure to support product analysis</li>
                    <li>News article recommendation systems for publishers</li>
                    <li>Deep neural networks to build captions for images, NLP
                        pipelines to dissect the media discussed in Hacker News,
                        and classification models to predict objects within
                        images</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>YOU + ME</h2>
                <p>If you have an interesting project, or have an inordinate
                    desire to philosophize about the nature of data, digital
                    art, or sound, find me:
